Revision history for Perl extension MOBY.

1.04
	- fixed bug in MOBY::Client::Central::DUMP that resulted
	  in an error ('Not an ARRAY reference at 
	  MOBY/Client/Central.pm line 1927') being raised.
	  Thanks to Pieter Neerincx for finding the bug and a
	  solution.
	  
	- fixed bug that allowed service types to be registered 
	  with empty ISA relationships.
	
	- MOBY::Config now only reads the config file once instead
	  of numerous times.
	
	- Attempted fix of shared memory bugs with service_tester.pl
	  Shared memory wasn't being recycled properly and led to the
	  server running the script to run out of memory segments,
	  causing the script to run, but not to produce any output. 
	  
	- MOBY WSRF implementation was not WSRF compliant in some 
	  points, and the same happened with sample code. Both the 
	  libraries and the generated WSDL have been fixed.
	
	- Added checks for those cases where RDF is wanted for a 
	  particular ontology that is empty. Instead of dying, 
	  we now return an empty document (as should be expected).
	  
	- Fixed a bug in the schema for secondary inputs. The schema
	  was missing the column 'description'

1.00
	- CVS version of MOBY released to the world via CPAN!
